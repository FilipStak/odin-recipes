      <strong>Sarma</strong> is a traditional dish popular in the Balkans,
      Eastern Europe, and Turkey. It’s essentially cabbage rolls stuffed with a
      savory filling, often served during holidays or family gatherings. The
      name “sarma” comes from the Turkish word for “wrap” or “roll.”.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Onion (finely chopped)</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>
        Spices: salt, black pepper, paprika, sometimes a pinch of cayenne or
        allspice
      </li>
      <li>Herbs: parsley, dill</li>
      <li>Pickled cabbage leaves</li>
      <li>Tomato paste or crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>Water or broth</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Smoked meat or bacon for extra flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the cabbage: carefully separate the leaves and cut out thick
        stems
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté onions (and garlic) in a bit of oil until soft. Mix sautéed onions
        with ground meat, rice, and spices/herbs. This is your filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a cabbage leaf and place a spoonful of filling near the stem. Fold
        in the sides and roll tightly, like a burrito. Place some leftover
        cabbage leaves on the bottom of a large pot to prevent burning. Arrange
        the rolls seam-side down in layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the sarma. Mix tomato paste with water or broth and pour over the
        rolls until mostly covered. Add bay leaves or smoked meat if
        desired.Place a plate on top to keep rolls submerged. Simmer gently on
        low heat for 1.5–2 hours until meat and rice are cooked and flavors
        meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sarma is often served hot, sometimes with sour cream on the side. It
        also tastes great cold the next day!
